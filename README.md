# C Game Framework For Android

This is a **C99 Android** framework built on top of **NDK** including **OpenGL ES** and **OpenSL ES** without 3rd party libraries. It is also using an own event system instead of "android_native_app_glue".

This project contains an example game which demonstrates the majority of the engine. It can be built and deployed from Visual Studio 2019.

The features and the architecture is similar to [Windows Game Framework](https://github.com/thealing/WindowsGameFramework).
